  <h1>How do infants learn about people, from people, and about their environment?</h1>
  <p style="font-size: 1.2em;">
    At the <strong>Developmental Social Neuroscience Lab (DSN Lab)</strong>, we explore how infants perceive, interpret, and respond to others’ emotions, actions, and intentions — and how they learn from people and their everyday surroundings.

## 🧭 Our Vision

Understanding how infants learn about people and their environments is a complex challenge that requires an integrative, multimethod approach.  
Our work combines **behavioural**, **eye-tracking**, **psychophysiological**, and **wearable** methods to study how emotion, attention, and social understanding develop in context.  

Using the **EgoActive** system — which synchronizes infants’ head-mounted cameras and body sensors — we collect multimodal, first-person data that capture how infants engage with others and explore their surroundings in real time.  
By integrating real-world and laboratory approaches, we aim to build a comprehensive understanding of how everyday experiences shape the developing social brain.

## 🔬 Research Themes

- **Learning about people**  
  How infants perceive and interpret others’ emotions, intentions, and actions.

- **Learning from people**  
  How social interaction, affect sharing, and attention guide infants’ emotional and cognitive development.

- **Learning about the environment**  
  How infants’ sensory and motor experiences in natural settings contribute to social and emotional growth.

## 🧰 Methods & Tools

We develop and apply tools for studying infant development in the real world:
- **EgoActive:** synchronized head-mounted camera and body-sensor system  
- **ASAP:** Automatic Sustained Attention Prediction method  
- **ECG pipeline:** open-source analysis for continuous physiological data  

See details on our [Methods & Tools page](/methods).
