Welcome to the **Developmental Social Neuroscience Lab** at the University of York, directed by **Dr. Elena Geangu**.

We study how infants learn **about people**, **from people**, and **about their environment** — integrating laboratory and real-world approaches to understand the foundations of social, emotional, and cognitive development.
