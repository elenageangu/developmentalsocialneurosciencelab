We use a multimethod approach to capture the richness of infantsâ€™ real-world experiences.

- **EgoActive**: synchronized head-mounted camera and body sensors for naturalistic infant studies  
- **ASAP**: Automatic Sustained Attention Prediction using wearable physiological data  
- **ECG pipeline**: open-source analysis of infant cardiac activity and arousal  

Our goal is to integrate real-world and lab-based methods to better understand early development.
