Our research investigates how infants learn **about people**, **from people**, and **about their environment**.  
We combine lab-based social neuroscience with real-world, wearable, and multimodal approaches.

#### Learning About People
- How infants understand others’ emotions and actions  
- Integration of visual, auditory, and bodily cues  
- Physiological and neural correlates of emotion understanding  

#### Learning From People
- Parent–infant synchrony and emotional co-regulation  
- Shared attention and social referencing  
- Social scaffolding of learning  

#### Learning About the Environment
- Naturalistic exploration through movement and perception  
- Interactions between affect, attention, and environment  
- Real-world emotional experience mapping
